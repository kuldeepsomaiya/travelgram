             <h3>SKY DIVING</h3>
             <p>Skydiving is an extreme sport that is still in it's nascent stage in India, but its popularity and presence is slowly spreading. Adventure travellers and sports fanatics are letting go of all their fears and indulging in this adrenaline pumping sport.Jumping off the edge definitely beats living on it. And if the edge is 14,000 feet on the periphery of the troposphere then you’re in a different league of precipitousness.</p>

             <h3>Paragliding</h3>
             
             <p>Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.As opposed to traditional non-motorized paragliders you can launch from level ground under your own power, flying as you please. Powered paraglider allows you to be as close to a bird as it is humanly possible.</p>

             <h3>Rock climbing</h3>
             
             <p>Rock climbing is a sport that makes you climb massive rocks, testing your endurance levels as it requires certain standards of fitness and acts as a good body workout. Red River Gorge in Kentucky encompasses the greatest concentration of arches and diverse routes. The variety of routes, superb weather, and year round climbing at Kalymnos, Greece, make it one of the best rock climbing destinations in the world. The list of the world’s best rock climbing locations is not complete without Yosemite National Park in California, which is meant for experienced climbers.</p>
